-----
To build an on-demand beauty booking and home service platform in React Native, you can follow this outline. Here's a simplified version of the codebase that covers the core features mentioned in your requirements, focusing on key aspects like booking, payment integration, notifications, and the beautician dashboard.
Setup the Project

First, make sure to create a new React Native project using the following command:

npx react-native init BeautyServiceApp
cd BeautyServiceApp

Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the project. We’ll need libraries for navigation, state management, payment gateway integration, push notifications, and others.

npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-maps firebase stripe-react-native axios react-native-push-notification

Make sure to follow the installation steps for each package as required (e.g., for react-native-maps and react-native-push-notification).
Structure of the App

Your app can have the following key components:

    Authentication (for users and beauticians)
    Booking System (with time slot selection)
    Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe/PayPal)
    Beautician Dashboard (for managing appointments and earnings)
    Admin Panel (for managing users and transactions)
    Notifications (for real-time updates)

Code Example for React Native App
1. Setting Up Navigation

Set up basic navigation with React Navigation.

import * as React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen';
import BookingScreen from './screens/BookingScreen';
import PaymentScreen from './screens/PaymentScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Booking" component={BookingScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Payment" component={PaymentScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

2. Home Screen (Main Landing Page)

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome to Beauty Service App</Text>
      <Button
        title="Book a Service"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Booking')}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;

3. Booking Screen (Booking and Time Slot Selection)

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, Picker } from 'react-native';

const BookingScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  const [timeSlot, setTimeSlot] = useState('');

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Select a Time Slot</Text>
      <Picker
        selectedValue={timeSlot}
        onValueChange={(itemValue) => setTimeSlot(itemValue)}>
        <Picker.Item label="9:00 AM" value="9:00 AM" />
        <Picker.Item label="11:00 AM" value="11:00 AM" />
        <Picker.Item label="2:00 PM" value="2:00 PM" />
        <Picker.Item label="4:00 PM" value="4:00 PM" />
      </Picker>

      <Button
        title="Proceed to Payment"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Payment', { timeSlot })}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default BookingScreen;

4. Payment Screen (Stripe Payment Integration)

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import { StripeProvider, useStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

const PaymentScreen = ({ route }) => {
  const { timeSlot } = route.params;
  const { initPaymentSheet, presentPaymentSheet } = useStripe();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Here you would call your backend to create the payment intent
    // and initialize the payment sheet.
    const fetchPaymentIntent = async () => {
      // Call your backend to create a payment intent
    };

    fetchPaymentIntent();
  }, []);

  const handlePayment = async () => {
    const { error } = await presentPaymentSheet();
    if (error) {
      console.log("Payment failed", error);
    } else {
      console.log("Payment successful");
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Booking Time: {timeSlot}</Text>
      <Button title="Pay Now" onPress={handlePayment} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default PaymentScreen;

5. Beautician Dashboard

This is a basic outline for a beautician dashboard that shows appointments and earnings. For the sake of brevity, let's mock the data.

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList } from 'react-native';

const BeauticianDashboard = () => {
  const [appointments, setAppointments] = useState([]);
  const [earnings, setEarnings] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch appointments and earnings from the backend
    const mockAppointments = [
      { id: '1', time: '9:00 AM', service: 'Hairstyle' },
      { id: '2', time: '11:00 AM', service: 'Makeup' },
    ];
    setAppointments(mockAppointments);
    setEarnings(200);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Your Earnings: ${earnings}</Text>
      <Text>Upcoming Appointments</Text>
      <FlatList
        data={appointments}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <View>
            <Text>{item.time} - {item.service}</Text>
          </View>
        )}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default BeauticianDashboard;

6. Firebase Push Notifications

For real-time notifications, you can integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging. Make sure to set up Firebase in your project first.

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';

const PushNotifications = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Request permissions for push notifications
    messaging().requestPermission();

    // Foreground message handler
    const unsubscribe = messaging().onMessage(async remoteMessage => {
      console.log('Notification caused app to open:', remoteMessage.notification);
    });

    // Clean up
    return unsubscribe;
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Push Notifications Setup</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default PushNotifications;

7. Google Maps Integration

Google Maps can be used to display beauticians' locations. You'll need the Google Maps API and react-native-maps to display the map.

import React from 'react';
import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';

const BeauticianLocation = () => {
  return (
    <MapView style={{ flex: 1 }} initialRegion={{ latitude: 37.78825, longitude: -122.4324, latitudeDelta: 0.0922, longitudeDelta: 0.0421 }}>
      <Marker coordinate={{ latitude: 37.78825, longitude: -122.4324 }} title={"Beautician Location"} />
    </MapView>
  );
};

export default BeauticianLocation;

Conclusion

This is a high-level structure for building your mobile application. You should expand each part depending on the complexity of your requirements, such as handling real-time data from a backend, integrating advanced payment features, and building robust UI/UX design. Additionally, you can deploy this app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store using CI/CD pipelines and make sure to handle proper testing before release.

For backend integration, you might consider using services like Node.js with Firebase or Django, and for payment gateway integration, you could integrate Stripe or PayPal APIs to handle payments securely.
